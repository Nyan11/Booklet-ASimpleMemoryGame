This booklet is the second iteration on the Memory game tutorial. 
It is inspired from the 2017 original Memory Game tutorial written by A. Chis, A. Syrel and S. Ducasse and entitled "Building a memory game with Bloc". This old tutorial is available on http://books.pharo.org. It uses the Sparta canvas to draw the card visual elements. In the Bloc version distributed by the Pharo consortium and that will be part of Pharo in the future, the Sparta canvas has been replaced by Alexandrie. In addition in the current tutorial, BlElement are used to display the card visual elements. We could draw using the Alexandrie canvas but this low-level API is not the best for an introduction to Bloc so this is why we decided to take a more pedagogical path.
